VISUAL PROMPT:
The dome silhouette dissolves into a curved projector screen back at TAMU Tidal Hackathon. Aarav jolts at his desk; timer reads 00:07:30. Rapid montage: he strips features, snaps code into clean modules; teammates lean in and sync—hands flying over keyboard, trackpad, and sticky notes—no arguing, just coordinated execution. The demo runs flawlessly on the big screen. - TAMU Tidal Hackathon branding

AUDIO DESCRIPTION:
Hard cut back to hackathon ambience: countdown beeps, fast typing, controlled breathing. Aarav: "Ship the core. Lock the handoffs." A clean success chime hits as the app output loads.
