## Title: **BUILD TIME**
**Genre:** Epic fantasy-action drama (Rajamouli-inspired)  
**Setting:** Present-day TAMU Tidal Hackathon (neon, rain-on-glass, kinetic); Agra, 1630s (warm gold, marble dust, towering scaffolds).  
**Characters:**  
- **AARAV**: Hackathon attendee—brilliant, exhausted, stubborn heart.  
- **EMCEE**: Voice of the “24-hour war drum.”  
- **USTAD KAMIL**: Master builder—calm, fierce standards, leader of artisans.  
- **TEAMMATES**: Aarav’s present-day crew—fraying, but loyal.

**Plot Overview:** Aarav’s failing demo triggers a daydream “time machine” via his badge QR. He lands at the Taj Mahal’s construction, helps solve a precision/logistics crisis using modern tools and hackathon thinking, learns the deeper truth—monuments are built by teams who iterate without ego—and returns to ship the prototype.

## SCENES (60–90s)

### 1) OPENING SCENE — “24 HOURS”
**Visuals:** Hackathon hall: LED strips, foggy breath, energy drinks, screens flickering like battle torches.  
**Action:** Aarav stares at failing code. Teammates argue softly.  
**Camera Transition:** Whip-pans between countdown timer and Aarav’s trembling cursor.  
**Close-Up:** Cursor blinks like a heartbeat. Aarav’s lanyard sways.  
**Text on Screen:** “TAMU TIDAL HACKATHON — 24:00:00”

### 2) MIDDLE — “BLUEPRINT PORTAL”
**Visuals:** Badge QR ripples into spinning blueprint lines; laptop fan becomes a deep, temple-like hum. Marble textures flood the screen grid.  
**Action:** Aarav reaches out—gridlines wrap his fingers like light.  
**Camera Transition:** Match-cut: laptop vent → swirling dust storm.  
**Close-Up:** QR code becomes a rotating dome schematic.  
**Text on Screen:** “COMPILING… 1632”

### 3) MIDDLE — “AGRA: THE IMPOSSIBLE BUILD”
**Visuals:** Taj site alive: elephants hauling stone, artisans inlaying, calligraphy panels lifted by ropes. Half-formed dome like a moon being born.  
**Action:** Aarav stumbles; Ustad Kamil catches him by the shoulder—steady as granite. Hands him a rolled plan.  
**Camera Transition:** Crane shot reveals scale; then snap to Aarav’s wide eyes.  
**Close-Up:** Chalk line trembling; one misalignment threatens a cascade.  
**Text on Screen:** “AGRA — TAJ UNDER CONSTRUCTION”

**Dialogue (subtitled):**  
USTAD KAMIL: “A line off by a finger… becomes a flaw for centuries.”

### 4) CLIMAX — “DEBUG THE DOME”
**Visuals:** Night. Torches. Rain begins. The dome frame groans under tension.  
**Action:** Aarav uses his phone level; draws a modular workflow on the plan—teams re-route materials, re-check symmetry. Artisans mirror his rhythm; he mirrors their precision. A rope snaps—Aarav lunges, braces a beam with a heroic shove as others lock it in.  
**Camera Transition:** Slow-motion on snapping rope → smash cut to Aarav’s shaking hands steadying.  
**Close-Up:** Marble dust on Aarav’s badge—present and past fused.  
**Text on Screen:** “ITERATE. ALIGN. LIFT.”

**Dialogue:**  
AARAV (to workers): “Small parts. Clear handoffs. One truth.”  
USTAD KAMIL: “Great works are not born in a day…” (beat) “…they are finished by teams who refuse to stop.”

### 5) ENDING — “SHIP IT”
**Visuals:** Dome silhouette dissolves into the hackathon projector screen curve. Aarav jolts awake at his desk. Countdown: 00:07:30.  
**Action:** He rewrites the build: strips features, makes modules. Teammates sync—hands flying, no ego. Demo launches—clean. Applause hits like a war victory.  
**Camera Transition:** Push-in on successful output → pull-out to stage-wide triumph.  
**Close-Up:** Aarav’s badge: a smear of marble dust… then it’s gone. He smiles—quietly certain.  
**Text on Screen (End Frame):**  
**“HACK TIME. BUILD THE IMPOSSIBLE.”**  
**TAMU TIDAL HACKATHON — Centuries of ambition. One weekend.**
