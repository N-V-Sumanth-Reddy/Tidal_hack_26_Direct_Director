## Locations Plan

### LOC001: Dim temple-like workshop with stone table centered under sanctum-like god rays. Moody teal/charcoal environment with warm gold light shafts and floating dust motes. Minimal, premium set dressing; focus on the stone table and sleek phone box.

**Type:** INT

**Key Features:** Central hero stone table (3' x 6'–4' x 8') with clean, premium surface and room for product lighting/control, Architectural overhead opening (oculus/skylight/clerestory) or controllable window source to create strong, directional god rays, Moody teal/charcoal walls/stone/plaster textures that read temple-like but can plausibly be a workshop, High ceiling (12'–20') with rigging points or permission to rig for beams, haze, and toppers, Light control: blackout-able windows/doors; ability to create deep shadows and isolate the table, Quiet interior with minimal HVAC noise; ability to control reverb (stone spaces often echo) via temporary treatment, Minimal set dressing zone: clean background, no clutter, no modern signage; premium, sparse props only, Safe haze/dust capability (hazer permitted; good ventilation control; dust motes visible in shafts), Flooring suitable for dolly/slider (smooth stone or can lay dance floor/track) with ample camera lanes, Load-in access for a hero prop crate/phone box, lighting cases, and haze machine without tight turns

**Alternates:** Deconsecrated chapel/crypt-like event space with oculus or clerestory (e.g., rentable historic chapel converted to gallery) — typically offers high ceilings/rigging permissions, controllable light, and sufficient power/tie-in options; confirm ambient noise and reverb treatment allowances., Historic stone basement/vault or castle/fort underground hall repurposed as a museum/event venue — strong temple textures and moody teal/charcoal grading potential; ensure generator access and cable pathways, plus permission to haze and black out any openings., Industrial atelier/stoneworking studio in an old warehouse with skylight sawtooth roof — workshop authenticity with controllable shafts through skylights; usually better power capacity and load-in, plus easier sound control than sacred stone interiors.

### LOC002: Same temple-workshop. The box is open on the stone table. The phone levitates above it as modular components begin to separate and orbit like a mechanical constellation. Teal shadows, gold rim light, dust in rays.

**Type:** INT

**Key Features:** Temple-meets-workshop interior: stone or plaster walls, carved/aged character, artisanal clutter (tools, relics, shelves) without modern signage, Large, photogenic stone table/altar (minimum 5 ft x 3 ft) centered for top/side coverage; stable enough for VFX/rigging plates, Controllable light environment: ability to black out windows and rig teal ambient fill + strong warm/gold rim backlight, High ceiling (12 ft+ preferred) and overhead rig points (beams/truss/pipe grid) to suspend a phone/prop and small orbiting components on monofilament or motion-control rig, Atmospheric capability: dust/haze visibility in light rays; permission for haze machine and/or practical dust (non-damaging) with HVAC control, Quiet, isolated location for clean sound (or permission for ADR) and the ability to secure the set for VFX continuity, Aged, textured surfaces that catch rim light: stone, bronze, wood; minimal reflective modern finishes, Adjacent support areas: small staging room for props/VFX parts, holding for crew, and a nearby loading path for cases

**Alternates:** Pasadena, CA (San Gabriel Valley) — interior of a historic craftsman/mission-style hall or museum workroom that allows filming permits through the city; look for stone/brick alcoves and controllable windows for teal fill + gold rim, with overhead rigging options, Alhambra, CA (San Gabriel Valley) — temple-like community hall or cultural center interior with carved wood/stone features; prioritize locations with easy permit routing via Community Development and a clear vehicle parking map requirement, Arcadia, CA (San Gabriel Valley) — estate or garden-adjacent pavilion interior with stone elements and high ceilings; select venues accustomed to film permitting where production can submit application/supporting documents by email and coordinate parking/load-in plans

### LOC003: Smash-cut composite inside the same temple workshop: foreground macro of phone back panel transforming into blue-black pellets/fragments hovering; background/secondary plane reveals a shoreline cleanup net on a beach that rewinds to a pristine dawn coastline (teal sea, peach sunrise). Diagonal motion blur suggests whip-pan.

**Type:** INT

**Key Features:** Temple-adjacent workshop interior with handcraft/repair vibe: aged timber or stone surfaces, workbench, shelving, and controlled clutter that reads as authentic but can be art-directed cleanly, Ability to stage a 2-plane composite in-camera: deep room with a long sightline or rear wall area that can be dressed as a 'beach cleanup' vignette (netting, sand tray/texture, driftwood) without revealing ceiling/grid, Macro-friendly set dressing: a bench area where a phone back panel can be rigged for transformation (pellets/fragments) with space for probe lenses, macro rails, and a small tabletop stage, Rigging points or discreet overhead grid for practical pellet/fragment hover (fishing line, magnets, air jets) and for adding diagonal motion elements to sell whip-pan blur, Blackout-capable (no uncontrollable daylight spill) so the background can be lit to feel like teal sea + peach sunrise via projection/LED wall/large diffusion frames, Clean acoustic environment for controlled takes (no loud HVAC/traffic bleed), with the ability to power down HVAC briefly for macro close-ups, Neutral-to-warm base palette (wood/stone) that contrasts with blue-black pellets and supports peach/teal lighting without color contamination, Loading access for film gear while preserving temple-like ambience (courtyard/side door acceptable)

**Alternates:** Kyoto, Japan — temple-adjacent artisan workshop/machiya studio with deep rooms and controllable light (ideal for smash-cut/whip-pan composite staging and macro rigging), Chiang Mai, Thailand — monastery-side craft pavilion/woodworking studio with open interior volume and rigging-friendly beams (supports abrupt cut aesthetics and layered planes), Bali, Indonesia (Ubud) — traditional carving/metalwork studio near a temple complex with textured wood/stone backdrop and blackout capability for teal/peach projection (strong for dramatic smash-cut transitions)

### LOC004: Macro-meets-epic in the temple workshop. The phone metal frame hovers above the stone table as a reverse forging plays: molten strip resolves into solid polished edge, ghosted timeline layers show scrap stacks and discarded frames behind. Crisp metallic highlights; teal shadows with warm gold accents.

**Type:** INT

**Key Features:** Temple-workshop aesthetic: stone/aged masonry surfaces, subtle sacred/ritual motifs, minimal modern signage, Hero stone worktable/slab (matte, slightly textured) large enough for macro tabletop builds and overhead rigs, Controlled atmosphere for 'reverse forging': ability to run practical smoke/haze, dust motes, and selective beams without HVAC fighting it, Background depth for ghosted timeline layers: space to stage scrap stacks, discarded frames, bins, and tool silhouettes behind hero table, Light control: full blackout capability, minimal ambient spill, rigging points for hard specular metallic highlights and teal shadow ambience with warm gold accents, Ceiling height sufficient for top-down macro rigs, small techno-crane/jib, and suspended 'hovering frame' wire/armature, Sound control for tight macro: low ambient noise, ability to quiet/disable HVAC and nearby machinery during takes, Fire/VFX readiness: safe zones and surfaces for heated props/steam effects (even if molten is simulated), plus clearance for VFX tracking markers and motion-control repeatability, Texture variety in-frame: oxidized metals, patina brass/copper details, dark stone, and controlled reflective elements for edge highlights

**Alternates:** Austin, TX — Purpose-built soundstage with a workshop set build (e.g., Austin Studios): controlled lighting/blackout, overhead grid for suspended 'hover' rigs, easy permitting pathway via Texas Film Commission guidance., Dallas/Fort Worth, TX — Industrial warehouse interior that can be art-directed into a temple workshop (e.g., Fort Worth Stockyards-adjacent warehouses or Dallas Design District industrial spaces): high ceilings, load-in access, room for scrap stacks and haze control; confirm city permitting and fire marshal for atmospheric effects., Houston, TX — Foundry/metal fabrication shop available for filming (off-hours) with adjacent clean bay (e.g., East End industrial fabrication facilities): authentic metal textures and tooling; require strict safety plan, sound control, and permits/permissions consistent with Texas Film Commission recommendations.

### LOC005: Climax in the temple workshop with intensified sanctum beams and higher contrast. The camera module blooms into shimmering grains that rewind into a clean, certified supply-chain vault overlay: tidy folders, QR-like seals, official stamps, steel vault door. Phone parts snap back together above the box; ARJUN catches it and powers it on, screen glow lighting MAYA's face.

**Type:** INT

**Key Features:** Temple-adjacent artisan/workshop interior with credible devotional/heritage cues (stone/wood textures, small shrine niche or sanctum doorway suggested, brass/metalworking tools, workbench) without requiring active worship space, Strong controllable shafts of light ('sanctum beams') via high windows, louvers, lattice (jali) or ceiling vents; ability to add haze for visible light rays and achieve high contrast/chiaroscuro, A dedicated 'clean overlay' zone within the same location (blank wall, smooth plaster, or dark negative space) to composite a certified supply-chain vault UI (folders, QR-like seals, stamps) and a steel vault-door graphic/plate, Practical surfaces for macro shots: workbench with small parts trays, fabric mat, jewelry-scale tools, and a box for the phone parts to assemble above, Ceiling rigging points or permission for temporary grid/truss to suspend invisible lines/magnets/VFX markers for the 'parts snap together' moment, Sound control: manageable ambient noise (no constant chanting/PA, minimal traffic bleed), enough separation to capture quiet beats and phone power-on sound, Art direction flexibility: permission to dress with archival-looking folders, stamped papers, QR decals, and to temporarily add/cover religious iconography as needed for continuity and sensitivity, Camera movement support: space for a small dolly/slider and a handheld orbit around the bench; safe floor for low-angle macro and top-down rig

**Alternates:** Thanjavur/Swamimalai (Tamil Nadu) temple-adjacent bronze casting or idol-making workshop: authentic metal artisan environment with devotional adjacency; look for a unit with high vents or jali windows to create sanctum-like beams and strong contrast., Jaipur (Rajasthan) old-city kundan/meenakari jewelry workshop in a heritage haveli: richly textured interior, controllable window shafts, and a workbench suited to macro 'parts' action; can stage a pseudo-sanctum corner without filming inside an active shrine., Kolkata (West Bengal) Kumartuli artisan studio (idol-making workshop): large, atmospheric interior with dust/haze potential for dramatic light beams; ample rigging space and textured craft environment to sell 'temple workshop' energy while providing room for VFX-friendly overlay plates.


**Permits Required:** City/County film permit for each location (commercial production for YouTube), Property owner/location agreement (indoor location releases for all 5 INT locations), Certificate of Insurance (COI) naming property owner/manager as Additional Insured, Fire department permit/approval if using smoke/haze, open flame, pyrotechnics, or special effects, Building management approval for elevators, loading docks, after-hours access, or restricted areas, Parking/loading permit if reserving curb space or using production vehicles in restricted zones, Police/security coordination permit/approval if using paid security, crowd control, or filming with replica weapons, Drone permit/FAA compliance (only if any aerial capture is planned)
