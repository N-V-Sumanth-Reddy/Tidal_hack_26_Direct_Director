## Scene 1

**Duration:** 5.0s

**Visual Description:**
Dim, temple-like workshop. A sleek matte-black phone box sits centered on a rough stone table. Sanctum-like shafts of light cut through floating dust motes. Top-down shot slowly pushes in as ARJUN (28, calm, principled) places his palm on the box. MAYA (26, skeptical) stands beside the table with arms folded, watching. The lid lifts upward unnaturally, as if pulled by rewinding time; subtle ripple in the air around the box edges.

**Audio Description:**
Deep bass thump like a war drum. MAYA (dry): "Another upgrade?" ARJUN (steady): "Not an upgrade. A repayment."

**Text on Screen:**
"Reverse Unboxing"

**Image Generation Prompt:**
Cinematic 16:9 storyboard frame in an epic tech-fantasy advertising style, consistent moody color palette (deep teal, warm gold light shafts, charcoal shadows), set in a dim temple-like workshop. A stone table centered in frame with a sleek, minimalist phone box labeled subtly “GreenPhone” (no other brands). Dust motes float through sanctum-like god rays from above. **GreenPhone protagonist: a 28-year-old South Asian male with short black hair, light stubble, athletic build, wearing a dark charcoal fitted hoodie and dark jeans** stands at the table, calm and principled, placing his palm gently on the box—stillness before a storm. Beside him is Maya (26, South Asian, sharp skeptical expression), arms folded, watching. Camera feeling: top-down angle transitioning into a slow push-in (show slight perspective shift, as if the camera is descending and moving closer). Close-up emphasis within the same frame: the protagonist’s fingers lifting the lid, but the lid rises upward unnaturally as if time is pulling it (subtle reverse-motion aura, faint chrono-distortion shimmer). Atmosphere suggests a bassy war-drum “thump” via visual tension and vibrating dust motes. On-screen text integrated cleanly in lower third: **“Reverse Unboxing.”** Justification cues: relatable “unboxing moment,” emotional intrigue and anticipation, clear message of something different and purposeful, premium visual aesthetics.

## Scene 2

**Duration:** 6.0s

**Visual Description:**
The phone rises above the open box, hovering. Micro-screws spin out by themselves in reverse motion and freeze mid-air. Modules separate cleanly: screen, battery, camera, and frame, arranged like a sacred constellation. 360-degree orbit camera move around the suspended parts; faint glowing symbols trace along module edges. Extreme close-up reveals a tiny engraved stamp on the metal frame: "TRACEABLE METALS".

**Audio Description:**
Low choir pad builds. Soft mechanical whirs in reverse. MAYA (surprised, softer): "Phones don’t come apart like this." ARJUN: "This one was born to return."

**Text on Screen:**
"Designed to repair. Built to last."

**Image Generation Prompt:**
Cinematic 16:9, same temple-workshop setting and lighting, same teal/gold palette and dust-filled sanctum rays. **GreenPhone protagonist: a 28-year-old South Asian male with short black hair, light stubble, athletic build, wearing a dark charcoal fitted hoodie and dark jeans** stands steady at the stone table, focused upward. The phone (ECOX/GreenPhone) floats above the open box; screws spin out by themselves, and modular components separate in midair—camera module, battery module, screen module—arranged like a sacred mechanical constellation. Add faint glowing symbols/runes etched on each module (subtle, not mystical overload—tech-mythic). Maya stands slightly behind, skepticism softening into awe. Camera look: a 360° orbit implied by a dynamic angled composition, with circular match-cut feeling (rings of motion blur arcs around the modules). Close-up detail visible on the phone frame: a crisp micro-stamp reading **“TRACEABLE METALS.”** On-screen text in clean modern type, mid-lower area: **“Designed to repair. Built to last.”** Justification cues: clear sustainability claim made tangible (repairable modularity), emotional shift from doubt to belief, sleek product-forward aesthetics.

## Scene 3

**Duration:** 6.0s

**Visual Description:**
Match-cut from the phone’s back panel to blue-black plastic pellets liquefying, then snapping backward into jagged fragments. Smash-cut to a shoreline cleanup net bulging with plastic waste. Time rewinds: fragments fly out of the net and arc back into the sea, reverse splashes rejoining the water. The coast transforms from littered to pristine, dawn light warming the horizon. Close-up on MAYA’s eyes reflecting the newly cleared shoreline.

**Audio Description:**
Ocean ambience in reverse swells, then resolves into calm waves. CHOIR VO (mythic): "What was taken from the tide… returns as purpose." MAYA (whisper): "It’s… undoing harm."

**Text on Screen:**
"Ocean-bound / Recycled Plastics"

**Image Generation Prompt:**
Cinematic 16:9, maintain the same color grading and mythic realism. Split-moment visual that reads like a smash-cut inside one frame: foreground shows the phone’s back panel mid-transformation, liquefying into blue-black pellets and jagged fragments hovering; background/secondary plane shows a shoreline cleanup net bulging with plastic on a beach. Time-rewind action: plastic fragments fly out of the net backward (reverse trajectory) and rejoin the water, revealing a pristine coastline at dawn—soft peach sunrise with teal sea, but still matching the ad’s teal/gold palette. **GreenPhone protagonist: a 28-year-old South Asian male with short black hair, light stubble, athletic build, wearing a dark charcoal fitted hoodie and dark jeans** is present near the transition space as an anchored witness, while Maya is closer to camera. Close-up emphasis: Maya’s eyes in sharp focus reflecting the now-cleared shoreline (reflection clearly shows clean waterline and dawn glow). Camera transition feel: whip-pan from net to horizon implied via diagonal motion blur streaks; reverse splash droplets frozen midair, arcing back into the sea. On-screen text in lower third: **“Ocean-bound / Recycled Plastics.”** Justification cues: relatable environmental concern made hopeful, emotional relief (“undoing harm”), visually beautiful dawn coast to reinforce positive impact.

## Scene 4

**Duration:** 5.0s

**Visual Description:**
Macro shot of the phone’s polished aluminum edge. The metal un-forges in reverse: pristine frame to molten glow, to cleaned scrap stacks in a bright foundry-like vision. Scrap rises, purifies, compresses into a single perfect ingot, then snaps back into the hovering phone frame in the workshop. Close-up emboss reads: "RECYCLED ALUMINUM".

**Audio Description:**
Foundry rumble reverses into a crisp, clean metallic tone. ARJUN: "Strength doesn’t need new scars." MAYA: "So it’s not ‘new’ metal… it’s rescued metal."

**Text on Screen:**
"Made from what we already have."

**Image Generation Prompt:**
Cinematic 16:9, same ad style and palette, with macro-meets-epic composition. The phone’s metal frame hovers midair above the stone table; its material “un-forges” in reverse: polished edge transitioning into molten glow (seen as a macro strip of liquid metal reversing into solid), then to neat scrap stacks and discarded frames behind it (ghosted reverse timeline layers). Action: scrap rises upward, cleans itself (debris pulling away backward), forms a single perfect ingot, then snaps back into the phone frame—capture the moment of reverse assembly with crisp metallic highlights. **GreenPhone protagonist: a 28-year-old South Asian male with short black hair, light stubble, athletic build, wearing a dark charcoal fitted hoodie and dark jeans** watches with calm conviction; Maya stands nearer, expression turning to impressed understanding. Camera transition: extreme macro on molten metal reversing into solid, with a hard-cut feel back to the hovering frame represented by a sharp focus shift and split-depth composition. Close-up readable emboss on the frame: **“RECYCLED ALUMINUM.”** On-screen text: **“Made from what we already have.”** Justification cues: clear message (recycled materials), strong visual metaphor (reverse forging), premium industrial beauty.

## Scene 5

**Duration:** 5.0s

**Visual Description:**
The camera module blooms into shimmering grains of gold/silver/tin that stream backward into a sealed, modern supply-chain vault vision: clean white walls, secure glass drawers, and neat documentation—no exploitation imagery. Three bold "passport" stamps slam down on papers in rhythmic punch-ins. Whip back to the workshop as modules reassemble with a sharp, heroic CLICK; ARJUN’s thumb powers the phone on, lighting MAYA’s face.

**Audio Description:**
Three thunderous stamp hits synced to cuts. Sonic reassembly click. MAYA (convinced): "You can prove every part?" ARJUN: "Truth shouldn’t be marketed. It should be shown."

**Text on Screen:**
"Materials with receipts."

**Image Generation Prompt:**
Cinematic 16:9 climax frame, same temple-workshop but intensified with brighter sanctum beams and sharper contrast. The phone’s camera module in the air “blooms” into shimmering grains (gold/silver/tin) that rewind into a sealed, modern certified supply-chain vault scene overlay—clean documentation, respectful verification visuals only (no exploitation imagery): tidy folders, QR-like seals, official stamps, steel vault door. Action centerpiece: three bold “passport” stamps mid-slam with dramatic motion blur and impact dust, arranged sequentially in the frame like thunder beats:
1) **“RECYCLED METALS — VERIFIED”**
2) **“OCEAN-BOUND PLASTICS — RECOVERED”**
3) **“REPAIRABLE DESIGN — PARTS AVAILABLE”**
Camera transition: rapid punch-in feeling on each stamp implied via layered scale and perspective; final whip back shown as the phone reassembling with a precise mechanical alignment (parts snapping together) above the box. **GreenPhone protagonist: a 28-year-old South Asian male with short black hair, light stubble, athletic build, wearing a dark charcoal fitted hoodie and dark jeans** holds the phone as it finishes reassembly; close-up focus on his thumb powering it on. The screen glow illuminates Maya’s face in soft light, showing conviction and awe. On-screen text (supporting, not conflicting with stamps) near bottom: **“Materials with receipts.”** Justification cues: skepticism answered with proof, emotional payoff (truth revealed), clear messaging via visible verification.

## Scene 6

**Duration:** 3.0s

**Visual Description:**
The intact phone rests in ARJUN’s hand; behind them, quick calm flashes of the coast, foundry, and vault fade into warm light. MAYA gently takes the phone and glances at her old device. On the phone screen: a simple UI option "TRADE-BACK + TRACK-BACK" and a module bay icon reading "Battery swap: 5 min" and "Updates: years". Final product hero shot on black with the GreenPhone device angled, premium reflections, minimal background.

**Audio Description:**
Music resolves into hopeful, grounded chord. CHOIR VO: "In a world that only takes… hold the one that returns."

**Text on Screen:**
"GreenPhone — The Phone That Gives Back
Built from what we already have. Made to last."

**Image Generation Prompt:**
Cinematic 16:9 ending frame, consistent color palette now calmer and brighter (still teal/gold, less shadow). The intact GreenPhone rests in **GreenPhone protagonist: a 28-year-old South Asian male with short black hair, light stubble, athletic build, wearing a dark charcoal fitted hoodie and dark jeans**’s hand, foreground hero emphasis with crisp product lighting. Behind them, softly blended “memory flashes” as luminous panels: pristine coast at dawn, gleaming foundry/ingot, certified vault—now serene and bright, suggesting resolved impact. Action: Maya gently takes the phone with care; in her other hand, she glances at her older worn device (subtle scuffs). The phone screen shows a simple UI option: **“TRADE-BACK + TRACK-BACK”** (clean, modern). Camera transition: slow push-in toward the phone screen; composition includes a subtle vignette hinting at a fade-to-black product hero shot. Close-up UI icons visible: **“Battery swap: 5 min.”** and **“Updates: years.”** Final on-screen super (center-lower, bold but elegant): **“Built from what we already have. Made to last.”** Brand line beneath: **“ECOX — The Phone That Gives Back.”** Justification cues: relatable ownership choice (trade-back), emotional closure (pride replacing guilt), clear CTA and product benefits, premium minimal hero-shot aesthetics.
