## Scene 1

**Duration:** 5.0s

**Visual Description:**
Extreme macro close-up of a premium EcoPhone smartphone matte-metal edge under heavy rain; mercury-like droplets bead and slide along chamfered corners. A fingertip slowly traces the edge. As the camera begins a slow pullback, the metal finish briefly flickers with ghosted overlays of jagged, oil-stained scrap metal textures, hinting at a past life. Stormy coastline ambiance in soft focus; lightning flash subtly reflects off the edge.

**Audio Description:**
SFX: thunder roll, rain patter, distant surf. VO (THE PHONE, hushed): "They called me new… but I’ve lived before." Subtle cinematic bass hit on the flicker.

**Text on Screen:**
"This is a flagship finish."

**Image Generation Prompt:**
Cinematic 16:9 storyboard frame, epic eco-action drama tone (Rajamouli-inspired), stormy coastline mood reflected only through lighting and reflections. **Extreme macro close-up** of a premium smartphone’s luxurious matte-metal edge, rain beads sliding like mercury across the chamfer. A **single fingertip** traces the edge (no full face yet), emphasizing “flagship” tactility. The metal edge subtly **flickers with ghostly reflections**: jagged scrap metal, oil-stained shards, hints of seabed debris—like a memory trapped inside the finish. **Camera transition implied:** macro perspective with a **slow pullback** feel (slight depth reveal, edge to corner). Color palette: steel gray, cold blue rain highlights, high-contrast storm lighting. Add on-screen typography (clean, modern sans-serif) bottom-left: **“This is a flagship finish.”** Atmosphere suggests distant thunder via dramatic cloud reflections and crisp specular highlights; ultra-detailed product texture, premium ad lighting, photoreal, shallow depth of field.

## Scene 2

**Duration:** 6.0s

**Visual Description:**
Underwater wide shot: a violent, gray-blue sea; coral is strangled by an abandoned fishing net like a serpent. Aarav, a young salvage diver in a worn suit with a headlamp, cuts through the turbulence and yanks the net free in one heroic motion; bubbles explode upward as the reef is released. Whip-pan to his gloved fist gripping a torn net fragment; morph-cut transforms the frayed fibers into a sleek, dark EcoPhone power button in close-up, clicking into a pristine phone frame.

**Audio Description:**
SFX: muffled underwater roar, strained pull, net fibers snapping; transition whoosh into a crisp mechanical click. Dialogue (MIRA, calm but iron-willed): "Waste doesn’t vanish, Aarav. It returns… as doom or design."

**Text on Screen:**
"Formerly: abandoned fishing net. Now: your power button."

**Image Generation Prompt:**
Cinematic 16:9 underwater action frame, same cool storm palette (deep teal, steel gray, cold highlights), high contrast. **EcoPhone protagonist: A 28-year-old South Asian male with wet shoulder-length black hair tied back, athletic build, medium brown skin, light stubble, wearing a dark charcoal salvage-diving wetsuit with subtle orange safety seams and a small wrist dive computer.** He is silhouetted in a violent sea environment underwater: coral in the background being strangled by an abandoned fishing net like a serpent. **Action moment:** EcoPhone protagonist yanks the net free in a heroic pose; bubbles burst upward like the ocean “exhaling.” **Camera language:** wide underwater silhouette composition with motion blur implying a **whip-pan** to his raised fist. In the **foreground close-up**, his clenched fist grips a torn net fragment; the fragment is depicted mid-transition as a **morph-cut concept**—half frayed net fibers, half transforming into a sleek **smartphone power button** with a crisp click impression (show the button shape emerging from the net texture). On-screen text (clean modern sans-serif, mid-right): **“Formerly: abandoned fishing net. Now: your power button.”** Keep it grounded and relatable: the net and coral look real and distressing, but the transformation promises hopeful design.

## Scene 3

**Duration:** 7.0s

**Visual Description:**
Scrapyard-furnace foundry at night: mountains of broken glass and e-waste glint like cursed treasure under floodlights. A towering shadow—The Waste King—stretches across the piles, indistinct and menacing. Mira, a focused materials engineer in heat gear, throws shimmering shards into a roaring furnace; molten light blooms like sunrise. Low-angle mythic shot of the furnace mouth, then a top-down shot of a glowing molten stream flowing into a mold, forming a flawless glass slab. Close-up of the finished display surface: perfectly smooth, but for a split-second it flashes faint landfill imagery beneath like a memory.

**Audio Description:**
SFX: furnace roar, clinking glass, molten pour. VO (THE PHONE): "Not mined from Earth’s bones… remade from her wounds." Music swells with heroic percussion.

**Text on Screen:**
"Formerly: discarded glass. Now: a display you’ll keep for years."

**Image Generation Prompt:**
Cinematic 16:9 foundry/scrapyard-furnace scene, same visual style and palette continuity (molten orange against steel blues, dramatic high-contrast). A mythic industrial scrapyard: **mountains of broken glass and e-waste** shimmer like cursed treasure. A looming, abstract **Waste King shadow** (not a clear person—an ominous towering silhouette formed by layered trash shapes and smoke) stretches across the scene. **EcoPhone protagonist: A 28-year-old South Asian male with wet shoulder-length black hair tied back, athletic build, medium brown skin, light stubble, wearing a dark charcoal salvage-diving wetsuit with subtle orange safety seams and a small wrist dive computer** stands close, arm raised to shield someone from debris. **Mira: a 28-year-old South Asian female with warm brown skin, slim-athletic build, dark brown hair in a tight low bun, wearing clear safety goggles, a beige heat-resistant foundry jacket over a dark shirt, and protective gloves** throws glass shards into a roaring furnace. **Camera transition implied:** low-angle on the furnace making it feel legendary; sparks and flying debris arc toward camera. Show a secondary inset-like composition feeling of a **top-shot**: molten stream flowing from crucible into a mold, forming a **flawless glass slab**. **Close-up emphasis:** the newly formed display surface is pristine and mirror-smooth, but within the reflection a fleeting “blink” of landfill history appears—tiny ghosted layers of cracked screens and dump piles beneath the gloss. On-screen text (modern sans-serif, lower third): **“Formerly: discarded glass. Now: a display you’ll keep for years.”** Emotional appeal: danger + teamwork + rebirth, clearly showing waste becoming premium.

## Scene 4

**Duration:** 7.0s

**Visual Description:**
Climactic storm inside the foundry: a cyclone of trash and plastic forms into a towering humanoid silhouette—the Waste King—reaching for the nearly-finished EcoPhone on a workbench. Aarav braces, gripping the phone’s frame as debris whips around. Mira steps in, steady, and locks the final module into place. The moment it clicks, the EcoPhone powers on; a wave of clean white-blue light blasts outward, slicing through the swirling trash like a shockwave. Camera performs a 360-degree spin around the phone as components snap into alignment in slow motion; insert close-ups of Aarav’s eyes shifting from fear to resolve and Mira’s thumb pressing the button.

**Audio Description:**
SFX: roaring wind of debris, deep rumble, then a sharp module-lock click and luminous power-on chime. Dialogue (WASTE KING, rumbling): "Everything thrown away… belongs to me." Dialogue (AARAV): "No. What we abandon… we must answer for." Dialogue (MIRA): "And we chose to rebuild."

**Image Generation Prompt:**
Cinematic 16:9 climactic transformation shot, same consistent color language: stormy steel blues with a decisive clean white-blue light. A vortex-like **cyclone of trash** spirals upward into a towering, semi-formed figure—the **Waste King**, made of swirling plastic, broken casings, nets, and smoke, reaching toward a nearly-finished smartphone at center frame. **EcoPhone protagonist: A 28-year-old South Asian male with wet shoulder-length black hair tied back, athletic build, medium brown skin, light stubble, wearing a dark charcoal salvage-diving wetsuit with subtle orange safety seams and a small wrist dive computer** grips the phone’s metal frame with both hands, bracing against the pull. **Mira: a 28-year-old South Asian female with warm brown skin, slim-athletic build, dark brown hair in a tight low bun, wearing clear safety goggles, a beige heat-resistant foundry jacket over a dark shirt, and protective gloves** locks the final module into the phone with precise control. **Camera motion implied:** a dramatic **360° spin** feeling—use circular motion blur streaks in the background trash cyclone while the phone remains sharp, parts snapping into place in slow-motion (modules hovering in alignment). **Close-up elements inside the same frame:** EcoPhone protagonist’s eyes visible with a shift from fear to resolve (wet lashes, intense focus); Mira’s gloved thumb steady on the power button. The phone **powers on**, emitting a wave of clean light that slices through the grim storm colors, pushing the Waste King back. No extra text required here (dialogue is implied by drama), but keep the scene’s message clear: reclamation vs consumption, rebuilding instead of discarding.

## Scene 5

**Duration:** 5.0s

**Visual Description:**
Hard cut to a pristine, minimal white ‘temple of tech’ studio. The EcoPhone stands upright on a clean pedestal like a crowned warrior, water droplets gone, lighting soft and premium. On-screen UI appears on the phone: "Scan Your Parts" with a rotating 3D exploded view; tap animations highlight components and show their recycled origins. Camera: clean hero shot with a gentle push-in to a razor-sharp close-up of a QR code on screen, high contrast and scannable.

**Audio Description:**
Music resolves into calm, confident tones. VO (THE PHONE): "Not made from the Earth. Made for it." Subtle UI tap SFX and airy studio tone.

**Text on Screen:**
"EcoPhone
Recycled materials, part-by-part.
Repairable design. Long software support.
Take-back program.
See the chain of custody (QR).
THIS PHONE USED TO BE THE PROBLEM"

**Image Generation Prompt:**
Cinematic 16:9 final studio hero frame, same premium photoreal ad style but now calm, pristine, and bright—minimal **white “temple of tech” studio** with soft shadow gradients and subtle reflective floor. The EcoPhone stands upright like a crowned warrior, perfectly centered, matte-metal edges consistent with Scene 1. **Camera:** clean hero shot with a gentle push-in feel (slight perspective depth). On the phone screen, show UI reading **“Scan Your Parts”** with a rotating 3D phone diagram and small tap callouts indicating material origins (clean, modern UI). **Close-up emphasis:** a sharply focused **QR code** near the bottom of the composition (either on-screen or adjacent on a minimal card), crisp and scan-ready. On-screen end-frame text (modern sans-serif, neatly stacked, right side or lower third):  
- **“Recycled materials, part-by-part.”**  
- **“Repairable design. Long software support.”**  
- **“Take-back program.”**  
- **“See the chain of custody (QR).”**  
Add bold super/tagline: **“This Phone Used to Be the Problem.”**  
Overall message clarity: proof, traceability, and trust—showing the chain-of-custody concept visually and making the sustainability claim feel concrete and relatable.
